# Doctor Marketing Agency Hacks That Get 20+ Leads a Week

If you're running a medical practice and struggling to get more patients every week, you’re not alone. With more competition than ever, simply being a good doctor is no longer enough.

Patients today look for providers **online**—and they make decisions fast. If your practice doesn’t appear where they search, they’ll go with someone else.

That’s where a **Doctor Marketing Agency** comes in.

At **Intellius Medical**, we’ve built and refined systems that consistently deliver **20+ high-quality leads every week**. Below, we’ll break down the exact hacks we use so you can start seeing the same results.

## What Is a Doctor Marketing Agency?

A **Doctor Marketing Agency** is not just a team of ad managers. It’s a full-service growth partner focused only on healthcare.

We don’t use templates or guesswork. We build custom strategies that help you:

- Get found on Google
- Build trust with new patients
- Turn traffic into booked appointments

Let’s walk through what actually works.

## Hack #1: Your Website Must Be Built for Leads

Most clinic websites look fine—but they don’t convert visitors into patients.

At **Intellius Medical**, we fix this first. Why?

Because a good website isn’t just pretty. It should work like your **24/7 front desk**.

Here's how:

✅ Fast page loading  
✅ Clear “Book Now” buttons  
✅ Mobile-friendly design  
✅ Simple contact form (name, phone, reason for visit)  
✅ Call-to-action on every scroll

👉 Don’t let your website waste traffic. Let our Doctor Marketing Agency optimize it for results.

## Hack #2: Rank Higher with Local SEO

Your ideal patient is already searching. You just need to show up.

That’s what smart SEO does. A **Doctor Marketing Agency** makes sure your clinic shows up when patients type things like:

- “Pain doctor near me”  
- “Weight loss clinic in Fort Worth”  
- “IV therapy Austin TX”

Our approach at Intellius Medical includes:

- Setting up Google Business Profile  
- Targeting location-based keywords  
- Adding local reviews  
- Creating service pages for your treatments  
- Posting blogs with real patient questions

## Hack #3: Content That Builds Trust (And Converts)

Patients don’t trust ads. They trust **information**.

We create content that answers their questions and keeps your name in their mind:

- Educational blogs (e.g., “What is Semaglutide really doing in your body?”)  
- Instagram carousels on treatments  
- FAQ pages based on actual search behavior  
- Stories that explain “before and after” expectations  
- Weekly newsletter emails

Your content should do one thing: **Make patients feel understood**.

## Hack #4: Ads That Actually Work

Throwing money at Facebook or Google won’t help unless the **right strategy** is behind it.

A proven **Doctor Marketing Agency** will:

- Run Google Ads targeting real patient searches  
- Write clear, honest copy patients can trust  
- Create landing pages that make booking easy  
- Set up call tracking so you know what’s working  
- Use retargeting to stay top-of-mind

We’re not talking about boosting posts—we’re talking about **scalable systems**.

Our campaigns often pay for themselves within weeks.

## Hack #5: Automate Your Follow-Ups

Here’s a stat most doctors ignore:

> 80% of leads don’t book on the first visit to your website.

You need a system to follow up.

At **Intellius Medical**, we build smart automations that do exactly that:

- Emails after form fills  
- Text reminders for missed bookings  
- Monthly check-ins with past leads  
- “We miss you” offers for cold leads

A strong **Doctor Marketing Agency** never lets warm leads go cold.
